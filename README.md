# Design Patterns in C#

A comprehensive project showcasing various design patterns implemented in C#. This repository demonstrates the practical application of widely-used design patterns in software development, aiming to help developers understand and utilize these patterns effectively.

## Included Design Patterns

- **CQRS Design Pattern**: Demonstrates separation of read and write operations for cleaner architecture.
- **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**: Implements a chain of handlers for processing requests.
- **Composite Pattern**: Illustrates component composition into tree structures.
- **Decorator Pattern**: Demonstrates adding behavior dynamically to objects.
- **Facade Pattern**: Simplifies interaction with complex subsystems through a unified interface.
- **Iterator Pattern**: Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing the underlying representation.
- **Mediator Pattern**: Facilitates communication between objects to reduce dependencies.
- **Observer Pattern**: Establishes a subscription mechanism for observing state changes.
- **Repository Pattern**: Centralizes data access logic for maintainable and testable code.
- **Template Method Pattern**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, allowing steps to be overridden.
- **Unit of Work Pattern**: Ensures a consistent state for transactions and reduces database round-trips.
